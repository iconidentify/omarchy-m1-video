# Development roadmap

The GitHub roadmap is the live source of ownership, blockers and progress: [iconidentify/libva-v4l2_request#7](https://github.com/iconidentify/libva-v4l2_request/issues/7).
The initial plan contains **54 leaf tickets in eight workstreams**, plus the roadmap and
shared workflow issues, across both repositories. This document is an index, not a second
status database. Check each ticket's current labels, comments and native dependencies.

## Next contributor wave

Use [the contributor entry point](CONTRIBUTOR_START.md) for bounded offline tasks,
public inputs and the live ready queues. It routes remaining real H.264 parser/admission work and a coherent HEVC
reference-content client adapter. The reference traces, VP9 model, field-feasibility
research and reference-memory audit are completed inputs. Allocation retry/startup
has an isolated candidate; capture-DMA coherence and runtime qualification remain
explicit gates. Check live claims before starting.
The current GitHub roadmap records the accepted resource/qualification evidence,
active claims and remaining hardware gates; historical r11 figures below are a
starting snapshot. Research acceptance never promises a new hardware capability.

## Agent entry point

Read [the claim and execution workflow](AGENT_WORKFLOW.md) before editing. Its GitHub copy
is [iconidentify/libva-v4l2_request#8](https://github.com/iconidentify/libva-v4l2_request/issues/8). Claim one ready leaf with a unique session ID, use an isolated worktree,
and coordinate shared files and exclusive hardware access. GitHub assignment alone does not
identify an agent when sessions share an account.

## Product target

Qualify a dependable Linux VA-API decoder across explicit codec/profile, bit-depth/chroma,
backend/device and client combinations. Preserve all current passing vectors; require
independent reference matches for every mandatory vector in a claimed supported row.
Keep full-suite denominators, unsupported formats, software fallback and untested hardware
visible. Compiled-in codecs, correct decoder pixels and a successful boot are different
kinds of evidence.

Historical M1 r11 starting snapshot: 35 sanitizer cases; 72,000 generated parser inputs within three
cases; HEVC 144/147, AVC 73/135, opt-in High 10 FRExt 27/69 and VP9 216/305; 864 additional
generated hardware frame comparisons. These results use the companion kernel patchset.
[Complete record](https://github.com/iconidentify/omarchy-m1-video/blob/main/docs/codec-validation-r11-2026-09-15.json).

## Delivery stages

| Stage | Exit direction |
|---|---|
| M0 - Reproducible foundation | Make support claims, test inputs, results and agent coordination reproducible. Exit: baseline schema/corpus/runner and build gates are usable from a fresh checkout. No calendar commitment. |
| M1 - Correctness and isolation | Eliminate reproducible corruption, memory-safety and lifecycle failures in declared supported paths. Preserve the exact r11 pass sets. Exit requires evidence for each closed defect. |
| M2 - Broader playback compatibility | Qualify additional formats, clients and devices against the support matrix. Hardware-dependent rows stay experimental until their acceptance evidence exists. |
| M3 - Production release readiness | Prove stress behavior, measured performance, maintainability, packaging and recovery. A stable claim applies only to qualified platform rows with no open release-blocking faults. |
| M4 - Hardware-dependent expansion | Discovery and implementation of kernel/firmware-dependent or presently unverified codec features. This is a gated research backlog, not a promise that all devices can decode every format. |

There are no invented deadlines. Hardware availability and explicit kernel/boot authorization
are real dependencies. Research tickets deliver reviewed decisions and implementation
contracts; closing them does not mean the feature is supported. The production qualification
[iconidentify/omarchy-m1-video#27](https://github.com/iconidentify/omarchy-m1-video/issues/27) distinguishes userspace qualification from boot-enabled distribution readiness.
An unresolved reset/corruption defect prevents a stable claim for the affected configuration.

Parent: [iconidentify/libva-v4l2_request#12](https://github.com/iconidentify/libva-v4l2_request/issues/12). Explain and fix the remaining reference corruption and intermittent parallel mismatches; qualify parameter-set changes and format boundaries without per-vector hacks.

### Complete VP9 state, resizing and format coverage

Parent: [iconidentify/libva-v4l2_request#13](https://github.com/iconidentify/libva-v4l2_request/issues/13). Preserve the 216/305 baseline passes and extend correct decoding across reference/size changes where the backend permits. Rejecting an unsupported stream is not a new conformance pass.

### Deliver correct playback through real clients and display paths

Parent: [iconidentify/omarchy-m1-video#7](https://github.com/iconidentify/omarchy-m1-video/issues/7). Connect decoder correctness to ordinary media playback, seek/adaptation, sandboxed browsers, colour and presentation. Container parsing and rendering dependencies remain assigned to their actual layers.

- [iconidentify/libva-v4l2_request#48](https://github.com/iconidentify/libva-v4l2_request/issues/48) — Build an end-to-end container and streaming playback matrix (P1, M2).

### Qualify platforms, boot behavior, packaging and releases

Parent: [iconidentify/omarchy-m1-video#8](https://github.com/iconidentify/omarchy-m1-video/issues/8). Earn production claims with platform evidence, reproducible packages, tested recovery and explicit release gates. An unexplained reset prevents a stable boot-enabled claim for the affected configuration.

## Updating the plan

Keep prerequisites as native GitHub blocked-by links and preserve parent/sub-issue relationships.
Document discoveries as linked children with concrete acceptance criteria; do not silently
widen a claim, delete a failing vector or close an implementation ticket after analysis alone.
The issue bodies contain starting points, implementation steps, acceptance checks, validation,
resource gates and handoff instructions. Final release claims require linked evidence.

All roadmap issues and this documentation were generated by AI at the owner's request.
Original upstream/contributor code and test authorship remain credited in the repositories.
