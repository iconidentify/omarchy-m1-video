# H.264, HEVC and VP9 follow-up — 2026-09-15

Validated driver: `1.3.r11`. Testing uses a local userspace build on the existing M1 boot,
with `linux-asahi 7.1.13.asahi3-1` and the same 15 kernel patches. No installation, module
reload or reboot is part of this follow-up.

## H.264: verified progress

### r9: reject incomplete pictures and invalid references before submission

EndPicture previously accepted a picture with additional slice parameters whose data had
never arrived. H.264 also allowed invalid active reference indices through to the kernel;
two unavailable surfaces could match because both resolved to timestamp zero. Version r9
rejects these inputs, checks that the VA slice type agrees with the parsed NAL, and validates
the next slice's references before flushing the preceding slice. Unavailable references
that no active slice list uses remain allowed.

A third fix rejects overflow when accumulating slice-parameter counts. The offline test
injects the counter boundary and reproduces an out-of-bounds write in the old copy operation.
It does not allocate billions of slices or establish a practical malicious-video exploit.

All three new regression cases fail against the preceding implementation and pass after
the fixes. The complete ASan/UBSan suite now contains 25 cases. Full hardware conformance
retains AVC 73/135 and FRExt 27/69 with High 10 enabled, and all five profile-override streams
still pass. All 144 generated High 10 comparisons match, including early export. These
are input-validation fixes; they add no interlacing, FMO or 4:2:2 support.

The pinned, stripped r9 package also passes strict HEVC at 144/147 and all 144 High 10
comparisons. Three consecutive full HEVC suites with four processes each pass 144/147,
with exactly the known serial failures. A half-second monitor observes no unrelated
browser/player decoder clients, and the decoder is idle after each run. No AVD messages
appear in the kernel log (one unrelated firewall message occurs). The historical concurrent
corruption remains open because its cause and triggering schedule are still unknown.

See [the r9 validation record](codec-validation-r9-2026-09-15.json) for commands, checksums,
per-vector results and package identity.

### High 10: 718 frames now match with an explicit compatibility mode

`FREH10-1` contains 360 frames; `FREH10-2` contains 358. Advertising High 10 alone produced
wrong pictures. FFmpeg 9.0.1 passes its internal quantizer bit-depth bias through VA-API:
the test stream's QP 21 arrives as 33. Removing the 12-step bias made every frame and both
complete reference checksums match:

| Vector | Frames | Reference and corrected hardware MD5 |
|---|---:|---|
| FREH10-1 | 360 | `87071917ba18e58e314e40e76fecafa4` |
| FREH10-2 | 358 | `853ed99f2badd6a8daea0c687e0c9e31` |

A generated 30-frame 640x360 High 10 clip with CAVLC, four slices and B pictures also
matched software through the packaged driver, including its cropped bottom edge.

A further generated matrix passes 144 frame comparisons: six clips covering CABAC/CAVLC
at QP 1, 21 and 51, four slices, B pictures and 640x360 cropping, each decoded normally
and with export before decoding. Exported dma-buf identity and layout stay stable.
The repeatable check is `tests/h264-high10.sh` in the driver fork.

The fork offers `LIBVA_V4L2_H264_HIGH10=ffmpeg` for affected FFmpeg-based clients and
`native` for clients that already submit the PPS syntax values. It stays disabled by
default. Both modes require a successful 10-bit H.264 SPS probe and usable 10-bit 4:2:0
CAPTURE output; context creation selects a capable decoder. The native mode preserves
the supplied quantizers. The compatibility mode subtracts the bit-depth bias, leaving
8-bit pictures unchanged.

With the new package installed, the tested copying path is:

```sh
LIBVA_V4L2_H264_HIGH10=ffmpeg mpv --gpu-api=opengl --hwdec=vaapi-copy high10.mkv
```

For development, also set `LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH=/path/to/build/src` and
`LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=v4l2_request`. This does not install the build. These two streams
establish progressive 10-bit decoding on this M1, not every High 10 coding feature or
other machines. Use the compatibility mode only with affected clients.

Primary-source context: FFmpeg's [PPS parser](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/n8.0/libavcodec/h264_ps.c)
adds the bit-depth offset; its [VA parameter construction](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/n8.0/libavcodec/vaapi_h264.c)
does not remove it. The experiment confirms the effect in the installed FFmpeg 9.0.1.

### Five Baseline/Extended streams already work when FFmpeg permits them

These original bitstreams decoded through VA-API and matched their complete reference
checksums with `-hwaccel_flags allow_profile_mismatch`:

- `BA3_SVA_C`
- `MR2_TANDBERG_E`
- `MR3_TANDBERG_B`
- `MR4_TANDBERG_C`
- `MR5_TANDBERG_C`

This is a per-file workaround for a profile-selection restriction. It does not implement
FMO, data partitions or all Extended-profile features. The default AVC result stays 73/135;
the five override passes are recorded separately.

### What still fails

All 49 failing Main-profile vectors in `JVT-AVC_V1` declare `frame_mbs_only_flag=0`.
The kernel explicitly rejects such SPSs. Even names containing `FRM` are not evidence
of a progressive-only stream. Interlacing needs kernel/firmware work.

The other 13 default AVC failures are seven Baseline and six Extended streams. Five
have the verified override above; the others include FMO, field coding and features
the current FFmpeg/VA path does not implement. A complete header scan confirms
`FM1_FT_E` changes from one slice group to FMO later in the stream; inspecting only its
first packet missed that feature. H.264 4:2:2 is still unavailable through
the VA fork. Direct GStreamer V4L2 has separate 4:2:2 coverage.

Malformed H.264 headers now fail before submission. Slice-group parameters are rejected
instead of being silently discarded. A failed RenderPicture also prevents EndPicture
from submitting a partially assembled frame. Regression tests cover these cases and
24,000 deterministic parser inputs under ASan/UBSan.

## Test totals must require hardware frames

Fluster's FFmpeg VA-API FRExt run reports 48/69 with High 10 enabled, but 21 of those
are 4:2:2 streams decoded in software. Checking only process success or the absence of
`Failed setup for format` is insufficient.

The new `tests/conformance.py` runner requires every output frame to originate from
VA-API, downloads it, applies the exact conformance crop, and hashes pixels at that
frame's native size. It records per-frame hashes, per-vector logs and fsynced JSON.
The strict FRExt result is **25/69 before, 27/69 with High 10 enabled**.

Its software CI test covers resolution changes, unaligned top/left cropping and truncated
input. The same generated resolution/crop checks also run on hardware. Hardware commands
remain wrapped by the lab's decoder preflight, finite deadline and wedge monitor.

## HEVC: narrowed causes, unresolved decoder failures

### RPS_B: reference ordering corrects every picture

A controlled userspace experiment changed only DPB ordering and remapped every dependent
slice/RPS index. The original VA order, POC order and CAPTURE-buffer order all failed.
Decode order matched all 300 frames and the complete reference checksum
`6d1ed392b067050ebd3a24a37281da03`. The full serial HEVC suite improves from 143 to **144/147**. A four-process run also
passes 144/147; Chrome held the decoder by completion, so this does not establish an
isolated concurrency result or close the historical intermittent issue.

Version r8 applies this workaround only when the selected V4L2 driver identifies itself as
`avd` and the SPS disallows long-term references. It retains the preceding full DPB plus its current picture, preserving old long-term
references without an expiring history ring. Surface ID and POC both identify a picture.
All VA slice and RPS indices are translated to the reordered DPB; other decoders retain
VA ordering. The underlying firmware ordering sensitivity remains unexplained.

The earlier 19/32-buffer rotation experiments did not correct the pictures. Reference
ordering is a distinct variable: comparisons normalized by POC had hidden it. No buffer
rotation, kernel change or per-stream recognition is shipped.

The unrestricted ordering experiment changed `RPS_E_qualcomm_5` from 26 wrong frames to
30, with checksum `7cf27c519b9740be6867e41bf1ab9ff5`. Therefore r8 leaves VA ordering
unchanged whenever the SPS permits long-term references. `RPS_E` keeps its baseline
26 wrong frames and checksum `b09ac8e0bd31a96d8354505d7c2ebdd5`. It remains a kernel/firmware
investigation alongside the intermittent concurrent failures.

### Reject invalid HEVC references and incomplete pictures

An invalid active reference previously became slot zero. The driver now rejects invalid
indices, missing active reference storage and out-of-range collocated references. Random-access
pictures may carry unavailable references that they never use; those are omitted, preserving
`RAP_A_docomo_6` and `RAP_B_Bossen_2` compatibility.

Malformed NAL headers, oversized/truncated slice data and invalid counts fail before a
preceding full batch is submitted. A failed RenderPicture blocks EndPicture from submitting
an incomplete picture. The sanitizer regressions cover these paths, index remapping, and
long-term references retained across 200 picture updates.

### VPSSPSPPS_A_MainConcept_1: selected FFmpeg client passes hardware

Direct GStreamer V4L2 passes the reference checksum. FFmpeg discards parameter sets whose
dependencies have not yet been seen, then loses pictures that refer to them. Its normal
output command also resizes later frames to the first output size. A tolerant FFmpeg
native-size decode retains only two frames (352x288 and 1280x720) and hashes to
`ec9f5857591ac4c215d194deaf52167c`, not the reference `1ddf74263cb4953cfdfcf99c563d88ea`.

Passing the stream through `h265parse config-interval=-1` recovers five frames but still
misses the reference checksum. The selected FFmpeg n9.0.1 client patch instead preserves
pending dependencies until activation. In a guarded VA-API run it emits all six pictures
at their native sizes (176x144 through 1280x720) and matches the reference checksum
`1ddf74263cb4953cfdfcf99c563d88ea`.

The complete strict hardware suite with that client passes **145/147**, 8,895 frames. An
exact pass-set comparison against r11 loses no passes and adds only
`VPSSPSPPS_A_MainConcept_1`; `RPS_E_qualcomm_5` remains wrong and the unequal-bit-depth
stream remains an expected rejection. The exact FFmpeg commit, patch hash, local binary
hashes and guard records are in [the issue #15 evidence](evidence/issue15/hevc-parameter-sets-2026-09-19/README.md).
The patch was not installed or packaged, so the shipped r11 stack remains 144/147 and no
driver-only release is credited with this client fix.

### Other HEVC limits

`TSUNEQBD_A_MAIN10_Technicolor_2` uses unequal luma/chroma bit depths. The kernel rejects
it deliberately because this format previously reset the firmware. Concurrent HEVC
pixel mismatches remain open; a successful individual run does not prove them resolved.
See [GAP_STATUS.md](GAP_STATUS.md) for boot and display investigations.

## VP9: validation and remaining gaps

Version r10 rejects incomplete pictures, invalid frame markers/sync codes, inconsistent
header boundaries, unsupported profile/bit-depth combinations, exhausted probability headers
and absent tile data. It preserves the full-range flag across inter frames, and keeps range,
loop-filter and segmentation changes pending until submission succeeds. Parse, append and
submission errors leave the previously committed state intact; a later asynchronous hardware
failure is outside that rollback guarantee.

Inter pictures must have all three reference slots backed by buffers in the same decoder
context. Two official resize streams (`vp90-2-05-resize.ivf` and `vp90-2-18-resize.ivf`)
triggered firmware H3 errors and two-second timeouts with r9 after FFmpeg replaced the context.
Both now fail in userspace with unavailable-reference errors before the offending submission,
with no new kernel messages. This closes the observed timeout path; decoding these streams
still needs support for reference pictures across size/context changes.

Four new Meson cases cover malformed submissions, state persistence/rollback, reference
validation and 24,000 deterministic parser inputs. All 29 cases pass under ASan/UBSan.
The new malformed/state/reference regressions fail against r9. The random-input case already
passed before the changes; it adds coverage rather than reproducing a new memory-safety bug.
The total of 72,000 generated H.264/HEVC/VP9 inputs belongs to three parser cases, not 72,000
independent Meson tests.

The final package also rejects all 25 previously wrong-output resize/scalable streams for
unavailable references. They no longer return successful decode with corrupted output in
this runner, but still fail conformance. Correct cross-size reference handling remains open;
its reviewed [VP9 resize state-preservation design (V1)](plans/issue-11-vp9-resize-state.md)
records the vector-by-vector acceptance mapping and explicit feasibility blockers.
The V2/V3 implementation children remain blocked on the required kernel contracts,
authorization and hardware evidence.

### Hardware evidence

The strict runner requires actual VA-API frames and hashes the native output dimensions.
The r9 baseline passed **216/305 VP9 vectors**, covering 3,334 output frames. The pinned, stripped r10 package
preserves every one of those passes in a complete 305-vector rerun, with no new AVD kernel
messages (one unrelated SMC message occurs). The official 10-bit 4:2:0 vector also passes all ten
frames, MD5 `a16b99df180c584e8db2ffeda987d293`. The five other high-bit-depth-suite vectors
use 12-bit or 4:2:2/4:4:4 output and are outside this result.

The new `tests/vp9-matrix.sh` checks eight generated 640x360 clips: 8/10-bit, full/limited range
and lossy/lossless, each decoded normally and with export before decoding. All **384 hardware
frame comparisons** match software. Encoded pixel format/range are checked explicitly, and
early-export backing is checked after each decode. These checks also pass using the final stripped
r10 package. Pixel comparisons do not establish correct
colour management in Chrome, mpv or another display path.

| Baseline failure group | Count | Current interpretation |
|---|---:|---|
| A width or height below 64 pixels | 60 | AVD kernel minimum; software passes |
| Profile 1, 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 | 2 | Outside advertised profiles 0/2; software passes |
| Context-changing resize streams | 2 | r10 rejects missing references before hardware submission; software passes |
| `vp90-2-21-resize_inter_*` | 24 | r9 gives wrong pixels; r10 rejects missing references; software matches reference |
| `vp90-2-22-svc_1280x720_3.ivf` | 1 | r9 and software both miss reference with different digests; r10 rejects missing references |

The full baseline exposed two firmware timeouts without a lasting wedge or kernel oops.
Subsequent candidate runs monitor new AVD journal errors as well as child deadlines and stuck
tasks. Do not repeat a firmware failure without a concrete fix to test. Refer to
[the r10 validation record](codec-validation-r10-2026-09-15.json) for source/package identity,
commands, individual results and separate baseline/candidate kernel-log windows.

## r11: shared picture lifetime and reference isolation

The shared API now reserves active targets, rejects their destruction, retains the first
RenderPicture failure through EndPicture, and cleans up failed begins. An earlier slice
completing cannot erase a failed submission. Shared reference lookup also requires the
surface to belong to the requesting context and its matching capture buffer, with no known
decode error. Context render-target hints no longer change ownership.

There are 35 passing offline sanitizer cases. ASan reproduces the old active-target
use-after-free with an intercepted codec. This is an API misuse test, not a media-file exploit.
The complete packaged-driver rerun retains the exact preceding pass sets: HEVC 144/147,
AVC 73/135, FRExt 27/69 with High 10 enabled, VP9 216/305 and five H.264 profile overrides.
The official VP9 10-bit 4:2:0 vector also passes all ten frames. All 144 High 10 and 384 VP9
ordinary/early-export frame comparisons match software.

A new test interleaves H.264, HEVC and 8/10-bit VP9 on one VA display, destroying shorter
decoder contexts while longer streams continue. Normal and early-export runs match 336
hardware frames against independent software decoding. This uses one thread; it does not
establish concurrent API-call behavior or throughput. These checks total 864 generated
hardware frame comparisons, separate from the conformance suites.

The final package's stripped driver is byte-for-byte identical to the implementation
package used for the full suites; the final source adds only the shared-context test,
its documentation and CI step. That additional hardware test uses the final package.
The guarded runs end with an idle decoder and no new AVD kernel messages; the full-suite
window contains three unrelated firewall messages. The initial run interrupted by mpv
is retained separately and is not counted as a complete run.

See [the r11 validation record](codec-validation-r11-2026-09-15.json) for source/package
identity, per-vector results and offline evidence. VP9 resizing and the other codec/display
limitations above remain open.
