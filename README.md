# omarchy-m1-video

Hardware video decoding (H.264, HEVC and VP9) for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) on Apple Silicon
Macs running the Asahi Linux kernel. mpv, Chrome and Chromium decode video on the Mac's built-in
video decoder (AVD) instead of the CPU.

## Development roadmap

See the [roadmap and ticket index](docs/ROADMAP.md) for planned codec, reliability,
client/display and release work across both repositories. Agents and contributors should
read the [claim and execution workflow](docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md) before taking a ticket.

## Contributing and reporting

**Next contributor wave:** [choose an offline codec or AVD task](docs/CONTRIBUTOR_START.md).
Humans and coding agents can contribute without owning an Apple Silicon test machine.

Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for repository ownership, offline checks
and PR evidence. Use [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for suspected vulnerabilities, and
[maintenance and handoff](docs/MAINTENANCE.md) for triage, review and release decisions.

## What it fixes

With the stock `linux-asahi` 7.1.13 AVD driver and `libva-v4l2_request-avd` 1.3:

| Problem | Fixed by |
|---|---|
| H.264 streams are rejected after 4096 slices, so longer videos stop decoding | kernel patch 0004 |
| The per-job instruction-segment table needs a large physically contiguous allocation | kernel patch 0003 uses `kvcalloc` for that CPU table |
| A job-completion race that can oops the kernel and lock `/dev/video0` until reboot | kernel patch 0005 |
| HEVC wavefront streams fail with firmware "H0 error", much more often with several HEVC videos at once | kernel patch 0006 |
| Monochrome (4:0:0) H.264 video shows green | kernel patches 0008, 0014 |
| An HEVC stream with different luma and chroma bit depths crashes the decoder firmware and resets it, disturbing other videos | kernel patches 0009, 0015 |
| 8-bit 4:2:2 H.264 with P or B frames decodes wrongly (affects apps that use V4L2 directly, such as GStreamer) | kernel patch 0007 |
| Memory-safety and robustness bugs in the driver: a use-after-free window, out-of-bounds writes and reads, a leaked 8 MiB job table, requests that never complete after an error | kernel patches 0010-0013 |
| Chrome shows solid green video | VA-API driver |
| H.264 videos with several CAVLC slices per picture hang | VA-API driver |
| HEVC streams with tiles or wavefront parallel processing hang | VA-API driver |
| 10-bit HEVC decodes to blank (all-zero) frames | VA-API driver |
| A crafted HEVC video can crash the process decoding it (stack overflow in the slice header parser) | VA-API driver |
| FFmpeg `hwdownload` can crash when context teardown races a frame download | VA-API driver 1.3.r6 |
| Decode errors and failed buffer waits are ignored; malformed image/slice data is insufficiently checked | VA-API driver 1.3.r6 |
| H.264 High 10 needs capability detection and FFmpeg quantizer correction | VA-API driver 1.3.r7, opt-in mode |
| HEVC `RPS_B_qualcomm_5` has ten wrong pictures with VA reference-slot ordering | VA-API driver 1.3.r8, AVD reference ordering |
| H.264 accepts incomplete pictures and invalid active references; slice-count arithmetic can overflow | VA-API driver 1.3.r9 |
| VP9 accepts malformed/incomplete pictures, loses inter-frame colour range and changes persistent state before submission succeeds | VA-API driver 1.3.r10 |
| Two VP9 resize streams trigger firmware timeouts after decoder-context replacement | VA-API driver 1.3.r10 rejects unavailable references before hardware submission; resize support remains incomplete |
| Destroying an active render target leaves a freed pointer; failed API calls can still submit incomplete pictures or clear an earlier error | VA-API driver 1.3.r11 |
| Reference buffer indices from different decoder contexts can alias | VA-API driver 1.3.r11 validates reference ownership and status |

Patch 0003 changes the CPU job table, not the decoded capture plane. Large capture
planes can still fail contiguous allocation after fragmentation; this remains
[#52](https://github.com/iconidentify/omarchy-m1-video/issues/52). Changing exported
buffer cache policy also requires a verified CPU/importer coherence contract.

Conformance on an M1 (bit-exact against the reference decoders):

| Suite | Through VA-API (FFmpeg) | Through V4L2 (GStreamer) |
|---|---|---|
| HEVC `JCT-VC-HEVC_V1` (147 streams) | 144 with packaged r11; **145 with the selected patched FFmpeg client**; 144 with four packaged-client test processes¹ | 143 |
| H.264 `JVT-AVC_V1` (135 streams) | 73 | 77 |
| H.264 FRExt `JVT-FR-EXT` (69 streams) | 25 by default; 27 with High 10 enabled | 35 |
| VP9 `VP9-TEST-VECTORS` (305 streams) | 216 | Not checked |
| VP9 high-bit-depth suite, 10-bit 4:2:0 subset (1 stream) | 1 | Not checked |

¹ The r9 package passed three consecutive four-process runs with no unrelated video clients
observed. Historical intermittent concurrent mismatches remain open.

The r11 package preserves the exact preceding HEVC, AVC, opt-in High 10 FRExt and VP9
pass sets. It also passes 864 generated hardware frame comparisons, including mixed
codecs sharing one VA display. See [the r11 validation record](docs/codec-validation-r11-2026-09-15.json).

The 145/147 HEVC result uses FFmpeg n9.0.1 commit `bf1b838f2ab88b4f8fd83443325c782ea0e0f7fa`
plus the pending-parameter-set patch with SHA-256
`a598cbf599060ff2bb105bb95a24c5dada122b58363ad9d24337cfb1f307f26b`.
It is a guarded local-client qualification, not an installed package or a driver-only
r11 improvement. See [the issue #15 hardware evidence](docs/evidence/issue15/hevc-parameter-sets-2026-09-19/README.md).

The VP9 high-bit-depth result covers only the suite's one 10-bit 4:2:0 stream (10 frames),
not its five 12-bit or 4:2:2/4:4:4 streams. An additional 384 generated VP9 frame comparisons
cover 8/10-bit, full/limited range, lossless/lossy and ordinary/early-export paths.
See [VP9 results and limitations](docs/CODEC_STATUS.md#vp9-validation-and-remaining-gaps).

Software FFmpeg also passes 143 of the HEVC streams, a different set. The H.264 streams that fail
through VA-API are interlaced (not supported by the kernel driver) or Baseline/Extended profile
features FFmpeg does not hand to VA-API. The first 1200 frames of four real H.264 recordings, up to
2560x1600, decoded bit-exact.

The FRExt VA-API totals above require actual hardware frames; Fluster alone also counts
21 software-decoded 4:2:2 streams. Five Baseline/Extended AVC streams additionally pass
with a per-file FFmpeg profile override. High 10 is opt-in because FFmpeg 9.0.1 needs a
quantizer compatibility mode. See [codec status and usage](docs/CODEC_STATUS.md) for the
718-frame High 10 conformance validation, 144 additional High 10/export comparisons,
and remaining HEVC/H.264 failures.

## Tested on

- MacBook Pro 13" M1 (T8103), Omarchy (omarchy-mac), `linux-asahi` 7.1.13.asahi3-1
  (AsahiLinux/linux tag `asahi-7.1.13-3`)
- mpv with `vo=gpu-next`, `gpu-api=opengl`; Google Chrome 152

Other Apple Silicon Macs use the same driver and may work, but have not been tested. Reports
(working or not) are welcome as issues.

## Before you install

This installs an **out-of-tree kernel module** that loads **at every boot** and taints the
kernel. It is not reviewed or supported by Asahi Linux.

On the test Mac, the machine **hard-reset twice within about a minute of boot** while kernel
patches 0001-0005 (unchanged since) were the module loaded at boot. The cause was not found and
may not be the module. Since then the patches passed parallel decode stress tests, 30-minute idle
soaks and device probe soaks with the module loaded by hand. With all 15 patches, loading at boot
has been retested **once** so far: the test Mac booted normally, decoded bit-exact and ran without
kernel or decoder errors for the following 10 minutes. That is one boot, not proof. Read
[If the Mac freezes or resets](#if-the-mac-freezes-or-resets) before installing, and test with
`modprobe` before you reboot (below).

## Install

Save your work first.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iconidentify/omarchy-m1-video
cd omarchy-m1-video
./install.sh --i-accept-boot-risk
```

`install.sh` refuses to run without `--i-accept-boot-risk`. It:
1. checks for an Apple Silicon Mac with the `linux-asahi` kernel, and that `linux-asahi-headers`
   matches the installed kernel (if not, update the whole system with `omarchy update`, reboot, and
   run it again);
2. installs build dependencies (`base-devel git meson libdrm libva libva-utils patch` and the
   headers);
3. builds and installs `libva-v4l2_request-avd` from
   [iconidentify/libva-v4l2_request](https://github.com/iconidentify/libva-v4l2_request)
   (`libva/PKGBUILD`, pinned to a commit);
4. copies the kernel patches to `/usr/local/share/apple-avd-patched/patches`, the rebuild script
   to `/usr/local/sbin/apple-avd-rebuild`, two pacman hooks to `/etc/pacman.d/hooks` and a boot
   service to `/etc/systemd/system/apple-avd-rebuild.service` (enabled);
5. builds the patched `apple_avd` module into `/usr/lib/modules/<kernel>/updates/`;
6. adds `vo=gpu-next`, `gpu-api=opengl`, `hwdec=vaapi` at the top of `~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf`
   (keeping a backup) unless mpv already sets any of them.

Then, **before rebooting**, test the module: save your work, close every video (browser tabs too)
and run

```sh
sudo modprobe -r apple_avd && sudo modprobe apple_avd
```

Play a few videos. If everything works, the module will also load at the next boot.

## Check that it works

```sh
sudo apple-avd-rebuild --status          # patched module installed for your kernel(s)
vainfo --display drm                     # lists H264 and HEVC profiles
mpv -v --hwdec=vaapi video.mp4 | grep -i 'hardware decoding'
```

The status command returns nonzero for a missing/wrong VA-API build or incompatible/unknown
libva ABI. Its module path identifies the file selected for the next load; it does not prove
which binary is already loaded. See [health-check semantics](docs/TESTING.md#health-check-semantics).

In Chrome or Chromium, open `chrome://media-internals` while a video plays: the decoder should be
`VaapiVideoDecoder`. Restart the browser if it was open before the module was loaded.

## Kernel updates

A pacman hook rebuilds the module whenever `linux-asahi` or its headers change: it fetches that
kernel's AVD driver source, applies the patches and installs the result. Leading patches that
upstream has already merged are skipped; if upstream has all of them, the stock module is used.
If the patches do not apply, or the source cannot be fetched (offline during the update), the
hook says so and installs nothing for that kernel; the boot service retries at the next boot
while the module is missing. A new kernel then boots with the stock driver and its bugs above
until the build succeeds (`sudo apple-avd-rebuild` retries by hand).

A second hook warns when a package update replaces the VA-API driver or a `libva` update needs it
rebuilt. Omarchy ships its own `libva-v4l2_request-avd`; if a newer version of that package is
published, a system update replaces this build. Run `./install.sh --i-accept-boot-risk` again
afterwards, or add `IgnorePkg = libva-v4l2_request-avd` to `/etc/pacman.conf`.

## Known issues

- **Vulkan output in mpv** (`gpu-api=vulkan`) shows a green/pink ghost picture: Mesa's
  Vulkan driver for Apple GPUs ignores the plane offsets of imported video frames. Use OpenGL.
- **Washed-out video in Chrome** for full-range H.264 files without a colour description (common for
  screen recordings). The diagnosed recording is fixed by adding its BT.601 colour description
  without re-encoding (use the actual colour metadata for other files):
  ```sh
  ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -c copy -bsf:v h264_metadata=video_full_range_flag=1:colour_primaries=6:transfer_characteristics=6:matrix_coefficients=6 out.mp4
  ```
- **Interlaced H.264 is not supported** by the kernel driver: decoding fails, and players may or may
  not fall back to software. H.264 4:2:2 still uses software through VA-API; High 10 is available
  with the [explicit compatibility mode](docs/CODEC_STATUS.md).
- **A few HEVC conformance streams** decode some pictures wrongly: `RPS_E_qualcomm_5` still fails; r8 fixes
  `RPS_B_qualcomm_5`. Historical concurrent failures also include
  `SLIST_B_Sony_9`, `SLIST_D_Sony_9` and `RAP_B_Bossen_2` when four streams decode at once.
  Not seen in real videos so far.
- **VP9 remains incomplete:** sub-64-pixel dimensions, inter-frame resizing and some scalable-video
  vectors fail. Version r10 rejects cross-context references in two resize streams before they
  trigger the firmware timeouts seen with r9. See [codec status](docs/CODEC_STATUS.md).
- **Firefox hardware decoding is untested.** Validate the normal sandbox before considering
  changes; disabling the RDD sandbox weakens isolation and is not a verified setup step.

See [gap status](docs/GAP_STATUS.md) for evidence, remaining investigations and the criteria
for closing them, and [testing](docs/TESTING.md) for repeatable checks in both repositories.

## If the Mac freezes or resets

If it resets or freezes shortly after boot:

1. **Before you can log in:** boot once with `module_blacklist=apple_avd` added to the kernel
   command line (in your boot loader's entry editor, append it to the line that starts the kernel).
2. **Once logged in:** keep the module from loading at boot and reboot:
   ```sh
   echo 'blacklist apple_avd' | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/apple-avd-noboot.conf
   ```
   You can still load it by hand after login with `sudo modprobe apple_avd` (restart the browser
   afterwards). Delete that file to load it at boot again.
3. Open an issue with `journalctl -k -b -1` from the boot that failed.

To remove everything instead, run `./uninstall.sh`.

## Uninstall

```sh
./uninstall.sh
```

Removes the boot service, hooks, script, patches and patched modules (the stock module is used
after a reboot). It leaves the VA-API driver package and mpv settings; the script prints how to
change those.

## Kernel patches

Applied in order to `drivers/media/platform/apple/avd` of the matching AsahiLinux/linux tag.

| Patch | Author | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 0001 | Aaron (aquarat) | allow cacheable (non-coherent) MMAP buffers |
| 0002 | Aaron (aquarat) | H.264: reject slices that reference invalid DPB entries |
| 0003 | Aaron (aquarat) | allocate the per-frame job table with `kvcalloc` |
| 0004 | Aaron (aquarat) | H.264: reset `slice_num` after each frame |
| 0005 | iconidentify | track the running job's state so a completion IRQ or the watchdog cannot finish a job that is still being built or submitted |
| 0006 | iconidentify | HEVC: read controls after applying the request, so a queued-ahead next picture cannot change the current picture's slice count |
| 0007 | iconidentify | size the compressed reference chroma plane for 4:2:2 (it was sized for 4:2:0) |
| 0008 | iconidentify | H.264: fill chroma with grey for monochrome (4:0:0) pictures, which the firmware leaves at zero |
| 0009 | iconidentify | HEVC: reject streams with unequal luma/chroma bit depth before they reach the firmware (narrowed by 0015) |
| 0010 | iconidentify | HEVC: copy the slice and entry point arrays for the run, so userspace cannot free them while the job is built |
| 0011 | iconidentify | HEVC: bound entry points to the array userspace sent; complete the request on every error path |
| 0012 | iconidentify | free job tables that were built but never submitted |
| 0013 | iconidentify | H.264: room for the header plus 4096 slices in the job table; stop the emulation-byte scan at the end of the slice |
| 0014 | iconidentify | H.264: correct grey value for 10-bit 4:0:0 |
| 0015 | iconidentify | accept HEVC 4:2:2 again; reject only bit depths other than 8 and 10, and 4:2:2 at 10 bit (no capture format) |
